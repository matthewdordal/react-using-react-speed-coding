# react-using-react-speed-coding

Code follows the examples found at [react-speed-coding-manuscripts](https://github.com/manavsehgal/reactspeedcoding)
## Node Version
Run with Node v6 or greater.  

The recommendation is to install Node
with nvm.  Once nvm is installed cd to the projects root directory
and run `nvm use` in the terminal to run the version of node specified
in the *.nvmrc* file.
